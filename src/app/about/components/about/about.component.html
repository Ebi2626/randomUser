        <h1>Recruitment task</h1>
        <p>Write application in Angular. The People and About tabs are separated pages (router outlets):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People tab should display random user from randomuser.me API (photo and name). If user click the "New"
                button the data
                should be reloaded with new data from API. Also every 5 seconds data should be reloaded, but the timer
                should reset
                every time user clicks "New" button and timer should stops counting if user's cursor is under photo,
                name or button
                (prevents from reloading data when fo example user trying to copy name).
            </li>
            <li>About is a static page with text description of the recruitment task (you're currently reading it).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both pages should looks similar to attached graphics. Please focus on code readibility and application
            performance (imagine that these are only 2 subpages of huge application).</p>
